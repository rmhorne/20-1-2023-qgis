            <abstract>The Justice Equity Services Index (JESI), by Advancement Project California, provides policymakers and advocates with the ability to detect where there are greater or fewer community-based organizations providing the vital services needed to support the communities most impacted by our justice system.The JESI groups service types into four main components to align with the broader service spectrum embraced by initiatives such as Measure J and the ATI Initiative, they include: Health &amp;amp; Wellness, including behavioral and physical health and wellbeing services. Housing &amp;amp; Employment, including housing, shelter, employment, and career training services.  Prevention &amp;amp; Intervention, including prevention, reentry, and youth development services. Community Services &amp;amp; Advocacy, including human services, advocacy, and community action services. The JESI offers advocates a comprehensive picture of community-based, justice-related, care-first providers and their functions in L.A. County. Each JESI component also includes a unique score to give a more nuanced view of where there is greater or lesser service capacity for each essential justice-related service.
