# An Introduction to QGIS and Digital Gazetteers

This introductory workshop will introduce participants to basic desktop GIS functionality in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) and digital gazetteers which underpin the majority of digital mapping research. Upon completion of the workshop, participants will be able to take an arbitrary list of places, associate that list with a digital gazetteer, and create a map in QGIS suitable for print or digital use. This workshop is geared to the beginner, with no prior knowledge of GIS required or expected.

## Before the Workshop

Prior to the start of the workshop, please do the following:

### Install QGIS
[https://www.qgis.org/](https://www.qgis.org/)
QGIS is a free, open source GIS. The website will guide you through the download and install process.


### Create an account on Recogito
[https://recogito.pelagios.org/](https://recogito.pelagios.org/)
We will be demoing Recogito as a web-based platform for creating Linked Open Data gazetteers. You should setup an account before the workshop begins.


### Create an account at Earthdata
[http://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov](http://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/)

This is necessary to use some of the plugins for QGIS that we will demonstrate in the workshop.

## Workshop Data
Although almost all of the data that we use for the workshop is easily downloadable, I will mirror it in this repository for ease of access.
